    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p> Commonly in neuroscience research, animal brains are probed with electrodes, measuring voltage signals from neurons while the animal performs a task.
        Electrodes have become so advanced nowadays that they can contain hundreds of sensors on a probe about the size of a human hair.
        During data analysis, this high dimensionality creates problems in computation and interpretation. It is hard to see what a 100-dimensional object looks like.
        Because of this, there has been a push towards dimensionality reduction models in neuroscience research. Researchers can reduce the 100 neurons down to 2 dimensions, allowing them to be visualized on a plot.
        Given that the data is recorded over time, the researchers can observe how the neurons "move" in this 2-D space. When these variables are plotted, they can be interpreted as neural trajectories. 
    </p>

    <p> The premise behind these models is that although the brain may be complex, maybe the underlying phenomenon is simple.
        For example, when you walk there are many millions of neurons firing, yet walking is simple, and so maybe the behavior of the millions neurons can be explained with just a few variables.
        For terminology, dimensionality reduced variables will be called latent variables, because they are not observed, but explain the observed data.
    </p>

    <p> For our project, we use Latent Variable Models to extract neural trajectories from a mouse as it performs a decision-making task.
    </p>

    <h2>What are we trying to predict?</h2>

    <p> We are trying to predict whether a mouse will turn a wheel to the left or the right.
        By plotting our neural trajectories, we may observe that there is a difference in the brain's "path" when the mouse turns a wheel to the left vs right.
        We will use this difference to create a classification algorithm to predict which direction the mouse will choose.
        Figures 1 and 2 show example trajectories that we might obtain.
    </p>

    <h2>What is our Data?</h2>
    <p> We use data collected by the International Brain Laboratory [IBL], which inserted Neuropixel probes into mice brains as they performed a decision making task.
        The task was as follows:

        <ol type="1">
            <li>A vertical grating is shown on either the mouse's left or right visual field. Simultaneously, a 5 kHz sine wave is played for 100 ms. These are the stimuli and go-cue respectively.</li>
            <li>The mouse uses a lego wheel to move the vertical grating to the center of the screen.</li>
            <li>If correctly performed, the mouse receives a water reward. If incorrect, a noise burst is played.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        The mouse repeated this task hundreds of times with probes inserted in its brain recording voltage signals at 384 locations.
        IBL has taken this raw electrophyisology data and performed their own preprocessing to give us neuronal units (clusters) and their spike times.

    <h2>What models are we using?</h2>

    <h3>Gaussian Process Factor Analysis</h3>
   
    <p>
        Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) models the observed data, y, as a linear combination of low-dimensional latent variables, z, using a Gaussian process. 
        The latent variables are modeled as a Gaussian process with mean, m, and covariance function, k_z(z_i, z_j). The observed data is modeled as a linear 
        combination of the latent variables, given by y = Cz + ε, where C is a loading matrix and ε is a noise term.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The goal of GPFA is to infer the latent variables and the loading matrix given the observed data. This can be done using maximum likelihood estimation by 
        maximizing the log-likelihood of the data, given by:
    </p>

    </figure>
        
    <p>
        where K_y = CC^T + σ^2I is the covariance matrix of the observed data and σ^2 is the noise variance. The solution provides estimates of the latent variables 
        and the loading matrix, which can be used to reconstruct the underlying patterns in the data.

    <h3>Variational Latent Gaussian Process</h3>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>

    <h3>EDA</h3>

        <figcaption>Fig.6 - Raster plot of a single trial. Y-axis represents depth.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        From Figure 6, we can see a flurry of neural activity in the MOp as the mouse begins to move. This increase in firing rate is what we hope to capture in our model.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>
        We chose to analyze data that came from the Primary Motor Cortex (MOp), Secondary Motor Cortex (MOs), and Primary Visual Area (VISp).
        We believed that the trajectories obtained from these regions would be more differentiable between the different behaviors we expect the mouse to engage in.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, we filtered clusters based on their quality. IBL has a metric for determining how "good" a cluster is, which indicates their confidence that the spikes came from a single unit.
        A bad cluster would indicate that IBL thinks the spike could have come from multiple units, which could add noise to our data.
    </p>

    <h3>Model Fitting and Trajectories</h3>
    <p>
        We train the model on a window that begins 0.1 seconds before the mouse starts moving to 1 second after the mouse started moving.
        This should allow us to see how the brain changes throughout the mouse's actions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Latent Variable Models were able to fit within a few minutes and inference took about 1 second per trajectory.
        Figure 6 shows a real output of the model.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        From the trajectories in Figure 6, we can see that it seems unlikely to be able to differentiate the mouse's behavior.
        As mentioned before, we want to see a clean separation between the trial types. 
        Nevertheless, we continue our analyses in the hopes that the classification model will be able to find a separation that we could not.
